#Object-Oriented Design

##Procedural vs Object Oriented

The world may be procedural or object-oriented. Objects are 'things' you interact with. They have behavior and state

Interaction between objects comes naturally. 

OOD requires modelling the world as a series of messages that pass between objects

Change in software is inevitable. Therefore applications that are easy to change are more pleasant to work with.

OOP: parts interact to produce the behavior of the whole.

OOD is about managing dependencies. It is a set of coding techniques that arrange dependencies wuch that objects can tolerate change. 

Objects that know too much have many expectations about the world they live in. The expectactions constrain them and make them less susceptible to change. 

##Design Principles

3 known techniques are SOLID, DRY and Law of Demeter

SOLID
- Single Responsibility
- Open Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

DRY
- Don't Repeat Yourself

Law of Demeter

Design Patterns are elegant known solutions to specific common and known problems. 

Design itself is a process of progressive discovery. Therefore Agile is a great way of design
